# My notes

Course: <https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/>

- Observer pattern (regarding the onAuthStateChangedListener) implemented in section 8 of the course is still a little unclear to me.
  - I am familiar with event based handling but because react has abstracted things so much, it seems like a really easy way to introduce side-effects that are hard to track down...
- Context implementation probably is a little fuzzy still for me, I don't know how it works in raw JS (cookies?) and as such I am not 100% confident with its use outside of the parameters that were covered in the course.
